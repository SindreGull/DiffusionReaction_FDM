# DiffusionReaction_FDM
This project explores how reaction-diffusion equations can model real-world phenomena such as the **spread of infectious diseases**. I implemented and analyzed a custom numerical method based on a modified Crank-Nicholson scheme, applied it to a spatial SIR model, and visualized the dynamics of an epidemic.
