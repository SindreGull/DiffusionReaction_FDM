# DiffusionReaction_FDM
This project explores how reaction-diffusion equations can model real-world phenomena such as the **spread of infectious diseases**. I implemented and analyzed a custom numerical method based on a modified Crank-Nicholson scheme, applied it to a spatial SIR model, and visualized the dynamics of an epidemic. Specifically it:

- Implements a stable and consistent finite difference scheme for solving time-dependent PDEs.
- Applies the method to simulate epidemic spread in space and time using a modified SIR model.
- Performs error analysis and derives convergence and stability criteria.
- Visualizes the disease dynamics using 3D surface plots.
